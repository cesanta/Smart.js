title: Flash the firmware
---

Now it's time to flash a built firmware.
Get one of the
[supported hardware modules](#/overview/hardware.md/),
for example TI CC3200 or ESP8266-based NodeMCU.
Connect a hardware module to your computer and run the following command:

```sh
$ dev flash -port /dev/ttyUSB0 -fw build/fw.zip
```

Note that the serial port on your system may be different.
