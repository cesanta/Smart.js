title: miot tool
---

Mongoose IoT platform comes with a swiss army knife tool, called `miot`.
It is used to practically all tasks - building and flashing the firmware,
setting device configuration, managing files on a device,
performing over-the-air updates, managing devices on a cloud, and so on.

Download `miot` tool from https://mongoose-iot.com/software.html

`miot` is a powerful instrument to integrate device management into the
development process. For example, it is easy to build an IDE plugin
to list and edit files directly on a target device, or to update a selected
list of devices remotely - either configuration files, or a full firmware.

`miot` tool is self-documented. Running it without arguments shows a help
string:

```
$ miot
Error: command required

  miot <command> ...


Commands:
  auth         Manage auth credentials for the Mongoose IoT
  cloud        Cloud operations
  dev          Work with local devices

```

To see the documentation for a certain command, type `miot COMMAND`, e.g.

```
$ miot dev fs
Error: command required
