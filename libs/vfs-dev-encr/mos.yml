description: A VFS device that encrypts reads and writes
  Reads and writes must be AES block aligned (16 bytes) and size must be a multiple of 16 bytes as well.
  Encryption key is not stored in memory. Instead, it is stored on an external device and read every time.
  This device can be any VFS device and only has to support 16-byte reads (for AES-128) or 32-byte reads (for AES-256).
  Offset is always 0.
